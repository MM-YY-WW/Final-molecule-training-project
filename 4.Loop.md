# 4. Loops

## 4.1 For loop and While Loop

Finish the following tutorials

[While Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp)

[For Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp)

## 4.2 Loop Practice

### 4.2.1 Reversed string

1. first create the variables and initalize them as the following:
```
input = 'nothing'
result = ''
```
2. Use a for loop to reverse the given input string.

3. Assign the reversed string to result variable

For input = 'nothing', the result should be 'gnihton'

### 4.2.2 Multiplication Table
 
Use a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number up to 10.

For example, if the given input is 5, the for loop should print out the following:

```
5*1 = 5
5*2 = 10
5*3 = 15
5*4 = 20
5*5 = 25
5*6 = 30
5*7 = 35
5*8 = 40
5*9 = 45
5*10 = 50
```


### 4.2.3 Find Prime Numbers
Use a while loop to find and print all prime numbers up to a given number.

For example, if the given number is 100, the while loop should print out all of the prime numbers that are less than the given number (100)


```
The prime numbers up to 100 are:

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
```
