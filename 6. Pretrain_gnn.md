### 6. Pretrain GNN Finetune
This week we will practice an example of reading through the paper and reproduce the result reported in the paper by using the official implementation they provided in the paper. 

## 6.1 Paper and Slides:
Read the paper: "[Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265)" 

[Pre-train GNN Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v73ZH6Kp7lPMBR8DBEgSAd7Bsv3aoVvq57qgSleGjCg/edit?usp=sharing) are available

## 6.2 Code Implementation
Find the official implementation of the paper: "Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks" on GitHub. Clone the repository to the local machine.

### 6.2.1 Setup Conda Environment
