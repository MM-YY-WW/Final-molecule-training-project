### 6. Pretrain GNN Finetune
This week we will practice an example of reading through the paper and reproduce the result reported in the paper by using the official implementation they provided in the paper. 

## 6.1 Paper and Slides:
Read the paper: "[Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12265)" 

[Pre-train GNN Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v73ZH6Kp7lPMBR8DBEgSAd7Bsv3aoVvq57qgSleGjCg/edit?usp=sharing) are available

Answer the following questions:
1. What is the background of the authors? Which school which lab?
2. When and which conference is this paper published?
3. What is pre-train model?
4. Why do we need to finetune the pre-trained model?
5. What are the pre-train strategies the author proposed? What are the pre-train tasks?
6. What are the meanings of the train/valid/test sets?
7. Which datasets are they used to evaluate their model performance?
   
## 6.2 Code Implementation
Find the official implementation of the paper: "Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks" on GitHub. Clone the repository to the local machine.

### 6.2.1 Clone GitHub repository
[Git and Github](https://github.com/MM-YY-WW/Final-molecule-training-project/blob/main/1.Preliminary.md#14-git-and-github)

Tips: Search paper title + GitHub in google could find the official implementation of a paper. 

For example [GitHub pretrain-gnns](https://github.com/snap-stanford/pretrain-gnns)

### 6.2.2 Setup Conda Environment
[Set up Conda Environment](https://github.com/MM-YY-WW/Final-molecule-training-project/blob/main/1.Preliminary.md#11-set-up-conda-environment)

The detailed environment setup can be found in the README file of the official implementation of the paper. 

### 6.2.3 Run pretrain-gnn finetune code with chem datasets

1. The instructions for running the finetune experiment will also shown in the README file of the official implementation of the paper.
