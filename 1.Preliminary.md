# 1. Prelimary

## 1.1 Set up conda environment:
:book: Recommand reading: [Conda environment management](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#activating-an-environment)


For example:
```
# <environment name> is the name of new conda environment decided by user
# xxx indicates version
conda create -n <environment name> python=xxx 
```

Enter the new environment by
```
source activate <environment name>
```
## 1.2 GPU and CPU

### 1.2.1 Make GPU available to use
First, install the cuda and dependencies with correct version under the new conda environment. (try ChatGPT or search online for suitable versions) 
[Previous Pytorch versions Install Command](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
```
# Example Template
conda install PyTorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=10.2 -c PyTorch
```

Next, type the following command in terminal to check if gpu is ready to use

```
python 
>>>import torch
>>>torch.cuda.is_available
```
If the results is True it means the gpu is ready.

### 1.2.2 Monitor CPU and GPU usage 
Open up a new terminal 

```
# check cpu usage
htop

# check gpu usage
nvtop
```

## 1.3 Install packages into certain conda environemnt:

Remember to enter the new environment by
```
source activate <environment name>
```
Then install packages under that environment:
```
pip install numpy
pip install numpy==1.24.1
pip install scikit-learn
```
list all the enviroments:
```
conda env list
```
list packages under environment:
```
conda list
```
close environment if want to switch to another environment:
```
source deactivate
```

## 1.4 Git and GitHub
:book: Recommand reading: [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

check if git already installed
```
git --version
```
if not 
```
sudo apt install git
```

### 1.4.1 Connect to remote repository from local 
:book: Recommand reading: [GitHub Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world), [About remote repositories](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories)

The following will use HTTPS method as an example:

First, clone the git to local:
```
git clone <HTTPS Link>
```
The HTTPS Link could be obtained from green button "<> Code" on repository main

For example, for this training project repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/MM-YY-WW/training_project_molecule.git

#if repository not found
git clone https://<Token>@github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPO_NAME>.git
#token generation will describe later
```

In terminal, change the directory to the folder of the reporsitory 
```
cd <folder name>
# type 'ls' in terminal could list out files and folder under current directory

cd training_project_molecule
```

setup user name and email from local terminal
```
git config --global user.name "your username"
git config --global user.email "your email"
git config credential.username "your username"
```
When the local repository ask for your personal token for authorization:

click the github head picture -> Settings -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained tokens -> Generate new token 

Tip: The token will only generate once when created, make sure to save the token to a safe place for future use. 

### 1.4.2 Add, Commit, Push
:book: Recommand reading: [Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git)

After modifying files, changes could be added by:
```
# Add all files
git add .
# Or add a sepecifc file
git add README.md
```

Comments are recommended before push the modifications to remote repository
```
git commit -m "the comments about the modifications"
```

After having comments, the modified version are ready to be pushed from local (origin) to remote (main) brach/repository
```
git push origin main
```

Renew the github webpage to see changes.

Others:
```
# check current modifications and status
git status
# check remote repository connection
git remote
git remote -v
```

### 1.4.3 Create a public repository 
1. Add README.md file: this file is used for introducing the project repository.
2. Seclect MIT license
3. clone this repository to local device 
4. In README.md file, write the date and a summary of today's progress ([Markdown documentation or '.md' file syntex tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax))
5. Use git add/commit/push to update the changes to remote repository.
