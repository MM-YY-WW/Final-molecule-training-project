# PyTorch Tutorial: Understanding Dataset and DataLoader

Welcome to this tutorial on how to use `Dataset` and `DataLoader` in PyTorch! By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to handle data in PyTorch for training machine learning models.

## What Are Dataset and DataLoader?

-**`Dataset`:** A `Dataset` in PyTorch is a way to represent your data. It could be images, text, or any other type of data. PyTorch makes it easy to create your own datasets by inheriting from the `Dataset` class.
  
-**`DataLoader`:** The `DataLoader` is a tool that helps you manage your dataset during training. It loads data in batches, shuffles it, and even helps with parallel processing to speed up training.

## Step 1: Install PyTorch

Before you start, please make sure you have PyTorch installed. If forget how to do it, please refer to the following:

[1.2.1 Make GPU available to use](https://github.com/MM-YY-WW/Final-molecule-training-project/blob/main/1.Preliminary.md#121-make-gpu-available-to-use)

## Step 2: Creating a Custom Dataset

Let's say we have a simple dataset of coordinates and their labels (whether the sum of the coordinates is even or odd). Here's how to create a custom Dataset:

```
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

classSimpleDataset(Dataset):
    def__init__(self):
        # Example data: list of (x, y) coordinates
        self.data = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)]
        # Labels: 0 for even sum, 1 for odd sum
        self.labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    
    def__len__(self):
        # Return the total number of samples
        return len(self.data)
    
    def__getitem__(self, index):
        # Get the data and label for a given index
        x = torch.tensor(self.data[index], dtype=torch.float32)
        y = torch.tensor(self.labels[index], dtype=torch.long)
        return x, y

```

__init__: Initializes the dataset. Here, we store the data and labels.

__len__: Returns the number of samples in the dataset.

__getitem__: Retrieves a data sample and its corresponding label by index.

## Step 3: Using DataLoader
Once we have a dataset, we can use DataLoader to load the data in batches, shuffle it, and parallelize the loading process.

```
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# Create an instance of the dataset
dataset = SimpleDataset()

# Create a DataLoader
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=2, shuffle=True)

# Iterate through the DataLoader
for batch in dataloader:
    data, labels = batch
    print(f"Data: {data}, Labels: {labels}")
```

**batch_size**: Number of samples per batch. Here, it's set to 2.

**shuffle:** Whether to shuffle the data each time we start iterating through the dataset. Useful for training.


## Step 4: Integrating with a Neural Network

Let's say you have a simple neural network. You can integrate it with the DataLoader like this:


```
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Simple neural network with one hidden layer
class SimpleModel(nn.Module):
    def__init__(self):
        super(SimpleModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 4)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(4, 2)
    
    defforward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Create an instance of the model
model = SimpleModel()

# Define a loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in dataloader:
        data, labels = batch
        
        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(data)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        
        # Backward pass and optimization
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    
    print(f"Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}")
```
**model(data)**: Passes the data through the model to get predictions.

**criterion(outputs, labels)**: Calculates the loss.

**optimizer.step()**: Updates the model's weights.
